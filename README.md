# TAQAT Talent Dashboard
Web scraping + data modeling + Power BI dashboard to support TAQAT (Gaza Works for the World) in connecting Palestinian freelancers and specialists with international recruiters.

What this project does:
  - Scrapes public talent/job data from selected sources (TAQAT-related pages and partner sites)
  
  - Cleans & standardizes skills, locations, rates, and availability
  
  - Models the data (dimensions, facts, relationships, DAX measures)
  
  - Visualizes insights in Power BI to help recruiters quickly find suitable talent

This repo underpins a presentation delivered to TAQAT and PTA Palestine to demonstrate data-driven matching between employers and freelancers.
